## get-issues.sh

Extract violation details from analysis result JSON files for a specific rule.

Given a directory containing one or more JSON files with analysis results (generated by the IDE), this script will print the description of the matched rule. This description can be used as input to the [/generate-issue-notes.md](../claude-code-commands/generate-issue-notes.md) command.

> `jq` must be installed and available on `PATH`.

To run the command:

```sh
./get-issues.sh <directory> <rule_id>
```

Example:

```sh
./get-issues.sh ~/spring-framework-petclinic/.vscode/konveyor/ spring-framework-5.x-to-6.0-removed-apis-00001
```
